# Gaypliments
thanks to Lumi for the idea :)

basically this just is gay compliments so yea

gender is a catagory

ex. if you type in man i'll use that string if you type in male it'll use the same string

if you want to add different ways to use any pronouns go for it

but again thanks to Lumi for this jokey script i just sat here for an hour working on this

if you don't have python don't worry you can see this online at
